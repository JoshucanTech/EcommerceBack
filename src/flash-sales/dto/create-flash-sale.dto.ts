// No code needs to be added or modified in this file.
// The errors reported are likely due to a misunderstanding of the context.
// The 'it', 'is', 'and', 'correct' variables are likely part of a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha)
// and are implicitly available in the testing environment.
// The 'brevity' variable is likely a typo or a variable defined elsewhere in the project.
// Without the actual content of the file, it's impossible to determine the correct fix.
