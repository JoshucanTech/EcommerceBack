// No changes are needed as the existing code is assumed to be correct and the updates indicate undeclared variables without providing context or code snippets to fix them.  It's impossible to determine the correct fix without seeing the original code. The updates suggest a potential issue with missing imports or variable declarations, but without the code, I cannot provide a meaningful solution.
